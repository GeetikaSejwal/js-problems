Given an array of bird where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id’s of the
most frequently and least frequently sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that
maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids & If more than 1 type has been spotted that
minimum amount, return the smallest of their ids.
E.g.: - Input – [1,1,2,2,4,4,4,4,5] Output – [4, 5]
Input – [2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,5] Output – [2, 5]
Input – [1,2,2,4,4,4,4,5] Output – [4, 1]

code:
function birdies(arr) {
    let large = 1;
    let count = large;
    let rees = 0;
    arr.sort();
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        largest = (arr.lastIndexOf(arr[i]) - arr.indexOf(arr[i])) + 1;
        if (large > count) {
            count = large;
            rees = arr[i];
        }
    }
return rees;
}
